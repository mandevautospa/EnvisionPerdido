The Ambassadors of the Key serve as the welcoming arm of the Perdido Chamber, focusing on member recruitment, retention, and engagement. This dedicated group of business and individual members acts as the connectors within our chamber community. They work to help members get plugged in by introducing them to fellow business professionals, Chamber events, and valuable resources.



Ambassadors help create a welcoming environment for new and existing members, assist with Chamber-hosted events, and work to increase visibility and engagement. Ambassadors try to ensure that every member feels welcomed, informed, and empowered to make the most of their Chamber membership.
