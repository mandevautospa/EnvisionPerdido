Find alternative funding sources! \"When Banks Say No\" provides an overview of alternative funding options for small business owners who need money to start, support, or grow their businesses.\n\n \n\nTakeaways you'll receive from this webinar:\n\n \n\n1. Hope! A \"no\" from the bank is not the end of the road. There are many options available for nearly any business situation.\n\n2. Understanding! We'll explain many funding options that banks just don't offer. One might be just what you need.\n\n3. Direction! When you identify one or two loan options that work for you, you can take the steps towards acquiring that money to start, support, or grow your business.\n\n \n\nPresenter: S. Boyd Karren, Managing Partner, Otro Financial. While he can help businesses in any stage of growth, Boyd specializes in finding funds for start-ups and businesses under two years old, which is the most difficult time for a business to get funding. Boyd has helped many businesses find the money they needed, even after banks told them no.\n\n \n\nPlease note, this is a virtual event. We'll see you online!",

    "description": "Pvt. Rosamond Johnson Memorial Ceremony\n\n \n\nThe Perdido Key Chamber of Commerce, in partnership with the Gulf Islands National Seashore, is proud to announce its annual Private Rosamond Johnson Memorial Ceremony. The ceremony will take place Saturday, May 3, 2025 at 10 am under the Star Pavilion on Johnson Beach, which is part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore.\n\n\n\nThe ceremony will honor and remember the life of Army Private Rosamond Johnson Jr.\n\n \n\nAfter enlisting in the Army at only 15, Johnson died in combat at age 17. Johnson rescued two injured soldiers and brought them to safety before he was fatally wounded while returning for a third comrade. He was the first Escambia County resident to die in the Korean War. Johnson posthumously received the Purple Heart on August 21, 1950.\n\n \n\nDuring the time of Johnson's death, Pensacola beaches were racially segregated. After the Korean Conflict, the county-owned recreational area was renamed to honor its fallen hero at the suggestion of the Sunset Riding Club, Inc. The club leased the land in 1950 from the county for the sole use of bathing, beach and recreational facilities for \"colored citizens.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough the lease was cancelled in 1956, the name Rosamond Johnson Beach remained. The area became part of Gulf Islands National Seashore May 8, 1973. A permanent monument in his honor was erected at Johnson Beach on June 10, 1996.\n\n \n\nEvery year, the Perdido Key community spends a day on Johnson Beach with its citizens and Johnson's family, honoring his memory and sacrifices. \n\n\n\nWe appreciate your support and involvement. For more information on this celebratory day, please go to Perdidochamber.com or our Visitors Information Center, located at 15500 Perdido Key Drive, Perdido Key, Fla.",

Find alternative funding sources! \"When Banks Say No\" provides an overview of alternative funding options for small business owners who need money to start, support, or grow their businesses.\n\n \n\nTakeaways you'll receive from this webinar:\n\n \n\n1. Hope! A \"no\" from the bank is not the end of the road. There are many options available for nearly any business situation.\n\n2. Understanding! We'll explain many funding options that banks just don't offer. One might be just what you need.\n\n3. Direction! When you identify one or two loan options that work for you, you can take the steps towards acquiring that money to start, support, or grow your business.\n\n \n\nPresenter: S. Boyd Karren, Managing Partner, Otro Financial. While he can help businesses in any stage of growth, Boyd specializes in finding funds for start-ups and businesses under two years old, which is the most difficult time for a business to get funding. Boyd has helped many businesses find the money they needed, even after banks told them no.\n\n \n\nPlease note, this is a virtual event. We'll see you online!",

They help families find strength, stability and self-reliance through affordable homeownership. But their impact goes beyond building houses. They reach wide across the community, with various programs and services aimed at transforming communities, one homeowner at a time.\n\n\n\nNorthwest Florida Community Land Trust is a shared equity homeownership model designed to make homeownership attainable for low-income households. The land trust is an effective alternative to renting for lower-income households seeking the stability of homeownership.\n\n\n\nLight pastries and coffee will be available for attendees, provided courtesy of our host, Stacey's at The Point, while supplies last.

Over many months, concertgoers responded via survey voting on pieces they'd like to hear us perform. We've chosen a varied program from the requests, ranging from familiar to rarely heard. The Choral Society of Pensacola invites music lovers to experience this concert, in the sanctuary of Cokesbury Church (5725 North Ninth Avenue). The concert also includes   \"One Day More\" from Les Miserables (Claude-Michel Schonberg)   the clear winner according to the polls   \"Lacrymosa\" from Requiem (Mozart)   a close runner-up and audience favorite   \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" (Paul Simon, arr. Shaw)   \"Sure on This Shining Night\" (Morten Lauridsen)   \"Daemon Irrepit Callidus\" (Gyorgy Orban) Directing our 105-voice chorus, we are excited to welcome back two Directors-Emeritus: Xiaolun Chen and Paul McGahie alongside current Artistic Director Peter Steenblik. They are joined by pianist Isabelle Areola. Steenblik will post a preview of the program on the Choral Society's YouTube channel on Monday, September 29th.

    "description": "Ambassadors of the Key Committee Meeting\n\n3rd Friday Monthly | 11:30AM | Location Changes Monthly \n\n\n\nAmbassador meetings are held once a month on the 3rd Friday at 11:30 AM at a different member restaurant each month. These meetings provide a great opportunity to connect, share updates, and collaborate on upcoming Chamber initiatives. Each Ambassador is responsible for the purchase of their own meal.\n\n\n\nThe Ambassadors of the Key serve as the welcoming arm of the Perdido Chamber, focusing on member recruitment, retention, and engagement. This dedicated group of business and individual members acts as the connectors within our chamber community. They work to help members get plugged in by introducing them to fellow business professionals, Chamber events, and valuable resources.\n\n\n\nAmbassadors help create a welcoming environment for new and existing members, assist with Chamber-hosted events, and work to increase visibility and engagement. Ambassadors try to ensure that every member feels welcomed, informed, and empowered to make the most of their Chamber membership.\n\n\n\nFor more information on how to become an Ambassador of the Key, contact Madelyn Bell, Membership Engagement & Events Director at 850.492.4660 or membership@perdidochamber.com.",
