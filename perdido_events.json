The concert also includes   \"One Day More\" from Les Miserables (Claude-Michel Schonberg)   the clear winner according to the polls   \"Lacrymosa\" from Requiem (Mozart)   a close runner-up and audience favorite   \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" (Paul Simon, arr. Shaw)   \"Sure on This Shining Night\" (Morten Lauridsen)   \"Daemon Irrepit Callidus\" (Gyorgy Orban) Directing our 105-voice chorus, we are excited to welcome back two Directors-Emeritus: Xiaolun Chen and Paul McGahie alongside current Artistic Director Peter Steenblik.
