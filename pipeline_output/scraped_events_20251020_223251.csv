Ambassadors of the Key Committee Meeting,"Ambassadors of the Key Committee Meeting

3rd Friday Monthly | 11:30AM | Location Changes Monthly 



Ambassador meetings are held once a month on the 3rd Friday at 11:30 AM at a different member restaurant each month. These meetings provide a great opportunity to connect, share updates, and collaborate on upcoming Chamber initiatives. Each Ambassador is responsible for the purchase of their own meal.



The Ambassadors of the Key serve as the welcoming arm of the Perdido Chamber, focusing on member recruitment, retention, and engagement. This dedicated group of business and individual members acts as the connectors within our chamber community. They work to help members get plugged in by introducing them to fellow business professionals, Chamber events, and valuable resources.



Ambassadors help create a welcoming environment for new and existing members, assist with Chamber-hosted events, and work to increase visibility and engagement. Ambassadors try to ensure that every member feels welcomed, informed, and empowered to make the most of their Chamber membership.



For more information on how to become an Ambassador of the Key, contact Madelyn Bell, Membership Engagement & Events Director at 850.492.4660 or membership@perdidochamber.com.",Location Changes Monthly,2025-10-17T16:30:00+00:00,2025-10-17T17:30:00+00:00,https://business.perdidochamber.com/events/details/ambassadors-of-the-key-committee-meeting-10-17-2025-38872,e.2644.38872,,,,https://business.perdidochamber.com/events/ical/ambassadors-of-the-key-committee-meeting-10-17-2025-38872.ics,https://business.perdidochamber.com/events/details/ambassadors-of-the-key-committee-meeting-10-17-2025-38872?calendarMonth=2025-10-01
